# 2D_FiniteElementMethod_GUI
GUI and algorithm on Matlab that calculates stresses and strains using 2D Finite Element numerical method 

- User can create a mesh of a 2D square geometry with a circular void in the middle, apply boundary conditions and analyze the results according to the 2D FEM method.
- This was done as a project for the 'Finite Element Method' final course project.
